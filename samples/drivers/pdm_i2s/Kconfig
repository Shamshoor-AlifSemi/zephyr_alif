config SAMPLE_FREQ
	int "Sample rate"
	default 48000
	help
	  Sample frequency of the audio system in Hz.

config AUDIO_BLOCK_MS
	int "Audio block duration in milliseconds"
	default 100
	help
	  Duration of each audio block in milliseconds.
	  Lower values reduce latency but increase CPU overhead.
	  Typical values: 50ms (low latency) or 100ms (balanced).

config AUDIO_NUM_BLOCKS
	int "Number of audio blocks"
	default 4
	help
	  Number of audio blocks in the memory slab.
	  More blocks provide better buffering but use more memory.
	  Minimum recommended: 2 blocks.

config DEBUG_MODE
	bool "Enable debug mode (capture then playback)"
	default n
	help
	  If enabled, captures 60KB of audio then plays it once (for debugging).
	  If disabled, runs continuous real-time audio loopback.
	  Debug mode is useful for extracting and analyzing captured audio data.
